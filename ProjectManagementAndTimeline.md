# Project Management & Task Timeline

## Current State & Unfinished Work (Inferred from Codebase)
- Error handling middleware is present but needs unification and more consistent error responses.
- Real-time collaboration (editing, locking, notifications) is implemented but needs further robustness and edge-case handling.
- Offline/PWA support is scaffolded (Dexie, service worker, manifest), but some sync/queue edge cases may need refinement.
- Dashboard and analytics features are scaffolded but can be expanded (more stats, charts, user activity).
- Search and filter for contacts/organisations is partially present; advanced filtering and fuzzy search could be added.
- Authentication is robust (JWT, refresh, socket auth), but features like password reset, email verification, and user profile management are still needed.
- Organisation member management (invite/remove, permissions) is partially implemented; role-based access control is not yet complete.
- Frontend notifications for real-time updates are present but can be improved (toasts, badges, in-app alerts).
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility are good but can be further improved (keyboard nav, ARIA, dark mode).
- API documentation and README are present but need regular updates as features evolve.
- Some backend queries and socket flows could be optimized for performance and reliability.

## Features That May Be Needed or Lacking
- Full role-based access control (admin/user permissions, per-organisation roles).
- Audit logs for critical actions (create, update, delete, login).
- Advanced import/export (CSV, Excel, vCard) for contacts and organisations.
- More analytics and dashboard widgets (activity, usage, trends).
- Dark mode toggle and theme support in frontend.
- Multi-language (i18n) support.
- Integration with external services (email, calendar, CRM APIs).
- More comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e).

## Task Timeline (Next 4 Days)

### Day 1
- Refactor and unify error handling middleware (backend).
- Expand and test real-time editing/locking flows (socket, frontend context).
- Write/expand unit tests for backend controllers and services.

### Day 2
- Implement advanced search/filter for contacts and organisations (frontend).
- Add user profile management UI and backend endpoints (edit profile, change password, avatar).
- Write integration tests for backend services and socket flows.

### Day 3
- Complete organisation member management (invite/remove, permissions, roles).
- Add/expand frontend notifications for real-time updates (toasts, badges, in-app alerts).
- Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility (frontend, ARIA, keyboard nav, dark mode toggle).

### Day 4
- Expand dashboard/analytics (more stats, charts, user activity).
- Add/expand API documentation and update README.
- Refactor and optimize backend queries and socket flows for performance.
- Research and plan for audit logs, i18n, and external integrations.

## Notes
- Tasks can be split further as needed.
- Prioritize writing and maintaining tests for all new features.
- Review and merge PRs daily; keep documentation up to date.
